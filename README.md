# LS Plus

A WIP Client-Side QOL mod to speed up and add convenience to certain aspects of gaming on a certain server.


## Current Features
### Custom PV Menu
The main feature of this mod currently is the custom PV browser menu.
Default Hotkey is N, but you can change the hotkey to anything you like in settings.

On first install you must sync your pvs to the mod by clicking the Sync button in the Custom PV menu, or by running /sync-pvs.
The menu saves automatically whenever changes are made to your player vaults.

### Automatically Enter Raffles
(On by Default) Command /autoraffle enables automatically entering raffles whenever they start. Helpful for those cheeky one second raffles and potentially winning something while afking.

## Version Support
Currently only Fabric 1.21.4 is Supported. But I have plans on expanding support to Fabric 1.21.5, 1.21.8, and MAYBE 1.21.1 (this one will take time due to how file structure has changed in 1.21.4)
